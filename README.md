## Welcome at my GitHub Account

I am a student of Climate Sciences with a special interest in the impacts of the climate system on us as a society. That is why I wrote my master's thesis about *the risk of hospitalization associated with foehn winds and heat in the mountainous region in Switzerland* with the Climate Epidemiology and Public Health group at the University of Bern.
